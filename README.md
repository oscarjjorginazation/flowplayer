# Flowplayer Flash

## Streamio Edition

At Streamio we use Flowplayer for compatiblility with facebook opengraph video. Be aware that this version of Flowplayer is not as fully featured as our own GoPlayer.

## Building

Make sure to have FLEX_HOME set to your flex installation directory and FLEX_HOME/bin in your execution path (we need mxmlc to be available etc).

Then follow [the original instructions](http://flowplayer.org/documentation/developer/development-environment.html).

## License

The Flowplayer Free version is released under the
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 (GPL).

The GPL requires that you not remove the Flowplayer copyright notices
from the user interface. [http://flowplayer.org/download/licenses/license_gpl.html](See section 5.d here).

Commercial licenses are available. The commercial player version
does not require any Flowplayer notices or texts and also provides
some additional features.
